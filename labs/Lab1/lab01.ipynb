    "    \n",
    "    def to_percentage\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Signature\n",
    "Next comes something called the *signature* of the function.  This tells Python how many arguments your function should have, and what names you'll use to refer to those arguments in the function's code.  `to_percentage` should take one argument, and we'll call that argument `proportion` since it should be a proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion)\n",
    "\n",
    "We put a colon after the signature to tell Python it's over.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Documentation\n",
    "Functions can do complicated things, so you should write an explanation of what your function does.  For small functions, this is less important, but it's a good habit to learn from the start.  Conventionally, Python functions are documented by writing a triple-quoted string:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Converts a proportion to a percentage.\"\"\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "##### Body\n",
    "Now we start writing code that runs when the function is called.  This is called the *body* of the function.  We can write anything we could write anywhere else.  First let's give a name to the number we multiply a proportion by to get a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Converts a proportion to a percentage.\"\"\"\n",
    "        factor = 100\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `return`\n",
    "The special instruction `return` in a function's body tells Python to make the value of the function call equal to whatever comes right after `return`.  We want the value of `to_percentage(.5)` to be the proportion .5 times the factor 100, so we write:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Converts a proportion to a percentage.\"\"\"\n",
    "        factor = 100\n",
    "        return proportion * factor\n",
    "Note that `return` inside a function gives the function a value, while `print`, which we have used before, is a function which has no `return` value and just prints a certain value out to the console. The two are **very** different. \n",
    "However, you can use print() if you just want to print out a value and you don't need to store the value in a name."
